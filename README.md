# Creating Wordlist

## Collaborative activity

Where it was proposed to create an algorithm that generates all combinations of words using `A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}` and `B = {a, e, i, o, u}` and `C = {b, c, d, f, g, h, j, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, z, k, y}`, create words formed by 3 pairs of consonants (C) and vowels (B) and 2 numbers obtained in (A).

Limiting your number in `10,000` words generated randomly and without repetitions.
